(Friday and Saturday) Two long-running big bands and New York institutions, each with its own perspective on the jazz tradition. Ms. Akiyoshi, who was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2007, employs the broad palette of postbop in her flagship band, which used to hold a regular perch at Birdland; Mr. Giordano, a generation younger in age but a generation older in spirit, still leads the Nighthawks on Mondays and Tuesdays at Sofia¡¯s Restaurant. If there¡¯s connective tissue between the two groups, it might be the tenor saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin, Ms. Akiyoshi¡¯s husband and a featured member of her band, but someone you could also picture hunkering down with Mr. Giordano. At 8 p.m., with preconcert discussions at 7 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, ; $30 to $120. (Chinen)
(Tuesday, Thursday through April 22) Wess Anderson, known in jazz circles as Warmdaddy, is an alto saxophonist with a tart sound and a bluesy, charismatic style.

(Thursday through April 22) Ms. Carter, the violinist, has explored timbres both rustic and cosmopolitan throughout her career.

(Tuesday through April 22) Jim Hall¡¯s economical style and harmonic command have made him a quietly imposing hero of jazz guitar ¡ª and, at 81, a certifiable legend.

The group has a new album, ¡°Live in NYC¡± (Ramboy), recorded on a night much like this one.

(Friday and Saturday) The pianist and composer Vijay Iyer just released ¡°Accelerando¡± (Act), the second album featuring his superb trio with the nimble but grounded bassist Stephan Crump and the magically propulsive drummer Marcus Gilmore.

He returns to a more ostensibly hierarchical trio format here, with Gregory Hutchinson on drums and Matt Penman, one of his fellow James Farmers, on bass. The results should be sleek and full of silvery digression. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037, ; $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

(Thursday and next Friday) The songs of Paul Simon, wry and questioning and musically savvy, provide one hook for this concert program, featuring Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.

And joining as a guest on Friday and Saturday is one of Mr. Wilson¡¯s regular collaborators, the singer Carla Cook.
