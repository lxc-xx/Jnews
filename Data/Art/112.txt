The earliest piece, ¡°Counter I¡± (1962), reminds you that Mr. Artschwager took an early career detour from studying art (with the French Purist Am¨¦d¨¦e Ozenfant) into making furniture. It has a slanted, lecternlike surface, perched on slim legs attached to wheels. From a distance, it could be mistaken for a piece of sturdy Shaker craftsmanship; up close, you can see that it¡¯s made of wood veneer accented with dark brown acrylic paint.
¡°Walker¡± (1964) and ¡°Piano¡± (1965) exemplify Mr. Artschwager¡¯s much loved Formica pieces, which owe their cartoonish surfaces to Pop Art and their blocky profiles to Minimalism. The piano¡¯s ivories can¡¯t be tickled, and the architectonic walker can¡¯t be moved without strenuous effort, but the invitation is there.
Also here is an uneven batch of paintings in black and white acrylic on Celotex (a wrinkly-textured fiberboard that is, along with Formica, one of Mr. Artschwager¡¯s signature materials). They range from the meandering, Duchampian ¡°Abstract Untitled¡± (1964) to the classically formalist ¡°Weaving 1¡± (1970), with vertical and horizontal bars that can be read as warp and weft.
Even the duds among them, though, reflect Mr. Artschwager¡¯s powerfully redemptive interest in the homelier substances of his time.
