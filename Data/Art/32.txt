His multipronged approach is well represented in from the 1980s. It revolves around a screenplay he wrote from 1979 to 1981 called ¡°Crocodile Tears.¡± Several plotlines emerge from the mix of photographs, texts, drawings, comics and Huebler¡¯s painted imitations of works by C¨¦zanne, Mondrian, Picasso and de Chirico.
A performance artist is to be assassinated while performing above a swimming pool containing live crocodiles. A collector negotiates with a shady man to acquire a stolen Degas painting. A story about a visiting artist at a provincial college art department is an acid sendup of academia.
Most of his collages of words and images include a nondescript photograph from his signature work, ¡°Variable Piece #70,¡± an endless project to photograph everyone alive. Captions state that at least one person in a given picture is ¡°the soul of kindness¡± or ¡°his or her worst enemy¡± or some such vapid characterization.
Mr. Huebler¡¯s production values were not as polished as those of many high-concept artists now, but they effectively animate ideas that are still relevant about money, power, ambition, institutions and other aspects of the art world¡¯s seamier side. What a shame that ¡°Crocodile Tears¡± the movie was never made.
