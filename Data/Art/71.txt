With its emphasis on recycled and rescued materials, it is the perfect medium to express ambivalence about finished art objects while making an overt connection to reality, which too much art is glibly accused of ignoring these days.
In his fourth solo show at this gallery, Michael Mahalchick plays this romance for all it is worth. His latest sculptures and wall pieces employ all kinds of detritus and discarded whatnots ¡ª from broken-down furniture to Christmas tree tinsel, and including some fried bacon ¡ª and were concocted during a performance at the exhibition¡¯s opening. (Photographs showing some of the before, during and after can be viewed on the .)
It is impossible to distinguish the effects of planning, artistic experience or last-minute inspiration, but in some instances the trash remains foremost trash; in others it is transformed into something more, helped along by associations variously shamanic and modernist. Several small wall pieces resemble decrepit riffs on Robert Ryman and Agnes Martin, although one titled ¡°Unshaven Leg,¡± which affixes shards of mirror and raw canvas to a small board, is more distinctive.
Repurposing a clear plastic bookcase, ¡°La Burubruja¡± (loose translation: lizard witch) evokes a small shrine, complete with offerings and intimations of a seated deity at its center, thanks to a bong encircled by red-tinted tubing. And ¡°Basketball Wife¡± achieves a sense of self-contained comic menace with a torsolike bottle form made of black webbing stuffed with paper and foil that rests on a small, round orange rug, whose curving black lines denote a basketball.
In Mr. Mahalchick¡¯s best work an almost devotional sense of precision shines through a thin veneer of slovenliness. Elsewhere the veneer thickens.
