Her singing is not flawless, but with her plush, shimmering sound and vocal charisma, she gives an uncommonly intense and vulnerable portrayal of the young, winsome French woman with a fatal weakness for riches and pleasures. Laurent Pelly¡¯s production combines colorful modern costumes with skewered-looking sets in an attempt to make the story seem more pertinent and gritty. But the result is at best ineffective and at time baffling. The tenor Piotr Beczala brings his ardent voice, good taste and dashing looks to the Chevalier des Grieux, who falls hard for Manon. Fabio Luisi conducts a stylish, lithe performance. At 8 p.m. on Saturday and 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, ; $112 to $470 remaining. (Anthony Tommasini)
(Friday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The increasingly invaluable Gotham Chamber Opera celebrates its 10th anniversary with a revival of its first production: Mozart¡¯s dazzling, rarely heard one-act ¡°Il Sogno di Scipone,¡± with a young cast directed by the incisive, searching Christopher Alden (of City Opera¡¯s new ¡°Cos¨¬ Fan Tutte¡±). Friday, Saturday and Thursday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4460, ; $30 to $125. (Zachary Woolfe)
(Saturday) Verdi¡¯s masterpiece is the final production of the small but serious Dicapo Opera¡¯s season, which included Loesser¡¯s ¡°Most Happy Fella¡± and Tchaikovsky¡¯s ¡°Iolanta.¡± Pacien Mazzagatti conducts; the leader of the company, Michael Capasso, directs; and the cast includes Anna Noggle, Jason Karn and Michael Corvino. (Closes April 22.) At 7:30 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, ; $50. (Woolfe)
(Saturday and Wednesday) Willy Decker¡¯s striking modern dress production of this Verdi favorite is a welcome change from its overblown Zeffirelli predecessor. Natalie Dessay (who was sick on opening night) is Violetta, the dying courtesan. Matthew Polenzani sings beautifully as her lover, Alfredo, and Dmitri Hvorostovsky wields his baritone to gorgeous effect as Germont. Fabio Luisi conducts. At 1 p.m. on Saturday and 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, ; sold out on Saturday, $112 to $400 on Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer)

(Thursday) The conductor Leon Botstein devotes an entire program to a single composer relatively infrequently, so when it happens, you pay attention. Here he honors George Crumb, an American maverick by any standard, with performances of ¡°Echoes of Time and the River¡± (which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1968), ¡°Variazioni¡± and ¡°Star-Child: A Parable¡± (with the Collegiate Chorale Singers and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus). At 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, ; $25. (Steve Smith)

(Thursday) This superb quartet is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and it is celebrating with a three-concert series at Weill Recital Hall. The first two installments were a project called ¡°Fragments,¡± for which the ensemble commissioned composers to write responses to unfinished works by great composers. The finale is a more conventional program, in the sense that it includes no unfinished music. But its scale is grand: the program brings together Beethoven¡¯s Quartet in B flat (Op. 130), complete with the ¡°Grosse Fuge,¡± and Busoni¡¯s electrifying Second Quartet. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, ; $65 (Kozinn)
(Sunday) When the young Stravinsky went to Paris, he became friends with, and fell under the sway of, Debussy, who was 20 years older and died in 1918. In this program many excellent players from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center explore that relationship through performances of seven works. The pieces range from Debussy¡¯s piano piece ¡°L¡¯isle Joyeuse¡± to Stravinsky¡¯s Concerto in E flat for Chamber Orchestra, ¡°Dumbarton Oaks.¡± At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 671-4050, ; $35 to $65. (Tommasini)
