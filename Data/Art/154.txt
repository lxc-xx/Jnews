This theatrical setting in the Brooke Alexander Gallery¡¯s creates a magical realm for works evoking rural and suburban bliss and anxiety, including: a heavy crate shaped like a doghouse by Richard Artschwager; cow prints by Andy Warhol; William Wegman¡¯s portrait of one of his Weimaraners posing with a ceramic squirrel; and a drawing of houses, apartment buildings and palm trees by Ken Price.
A flagstone path leads to a far corner and a door with a knocker in the form of a bronze fist hanging from a heavy chain, by Tom Otterness. Beyond is an incomplete house interior where wooden studs are up but not the drywall. Just to the left in the front hall hangs a sweet lithograph by Philip Guston, depicting trousers and a long scarf hanging from hooks, and boots on the floor.
Opposite, where you would expect to find snapshots of family members, is a set of photographic portraits made by David Robbins, resembling actors¡¯ head shots. Called ¡°Talent¡± and made in 1986, it pictures Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer and seven other artists who were young and rising at the time.
Distributed through the labyrinthine domestic space are about 50 other paintings, prints and sculptures by artists including Bruce Nauman, Raymond Pettibon, Ms. Sherman and Ed Ruscha. They generate a darkly comic ambience of innocence, experience and madness.
