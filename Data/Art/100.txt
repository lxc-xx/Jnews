The rapper GZA is known as the Genius to the Wu-Tang Clan¡¯s legion of fans and as professor to students who attended his recent lectures at Harvard and New York University; he recently finished work on ¡°Dark Matter¡± (Babygrande), a record partly inspired by quantum physics. At 8 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, ; sold out. (Stacey Anderson)
(Friday and Saturday) The gritty boogie R&B singer-pianist wraps his trio of weekend residencies at the Howard Gilman Opera House with a revue of the swampy, R&B-laden funk on which he¡¯s built his name. Guests include Ivan Neville, Nicholas Payton and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. At 8 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, ; $30 to $65. (Anderson)
(Friday) The soft-rockers from Denver attempt to regain the stadium-packing glory of their 2005 debut, ¡°How to Save a Life¡± (Sony/Epic), with their third studio album, ¡°Scars & Stories¡± (Sony/Epic). Its grandiose, sober symphonics suggest a rock band at diametric odds with the concept of having fun. At 1 p.m., Major League Baseball Fan Cave, East Fourth Street at Broadway, East Village, ; free. (Anderson)
(Friday) The hippest space on Museum Mile begins its Divine Ricochet series, a trio of concerts that augment the current ¡°John Chamberlain: Choices¡± retrospective. First at bat is Grouper, the flourishing solo project of the anachronistic acoustic noise artist Liz Harris. With Julianna Barwick. Doors open at 8:30 p.m., performance begins at 10 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, ; $22 for members, or $27 for general admission. (Anderson)
(Monday) Mr. Hawthorne, a spit-shined soul-popper in the vein of Curtis Mayfield, hides his devilish streak behind thick Buddy Holly glasses. Intuitive hooks and sparkling brass made his 2011 effort, ¡°How Do You Do?¡± (Universal Republic), top-tier revivalist entertainment. With the Stepkids. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, ; $20. (Anderson)
(Wednesday) ¡°Friends of Friends,¡± the breakthrough single for this Brooklyn indie-pop trio, is a winsome blend of chirping vocals and deft guitar trills. However, the rest of the group¡¯s self-titled debut (on Merge) is an earthier set of fables about lost loves and frustrating careers, anchored in feathery guitars that turn torrid in a flash. With Eleanor Friedberger. At 8 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, (718) 643-6510, ; $12. (Anderson)
(Friday to Tuesday) The modestly self-described ¡°robot pop¡± that was Kraftwerk¡¯s mid-1970s, minimalist electronic music proved to be some of the most influential pop of the era; the roots of its slim beats and technological curiosity can be unearthed today in New Wave, electronica, dubstep and more. For this chronological series at the Museum of Modern Art, the group will perform one of its eight studio albums alongside 3-D visualizations and perform other, newly re-orchestrated selections from their catalog. Friday and Tuesday at 10 p.m., Saturday, Sunday and Monday at 8:30 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, ; sold out. (Anderson)
(Thursday and next Friday) The Afro-Caribbean bluesman delivered one of last year¡¯s most touching musical moments when he performed a duet with Deva Mahal, his daughter, on his lullaby ¡°Lovin¡¯ in My Baby¡¯s Eyes¡± at Carnegie Hall¡¯s Tibet House Benefit. Forty years into his storied career, Mr. Mahal brings his Grammy-winning alchemy of gruff wails, searching harmonica and nontraditional tropicalia beats to this pristine club. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9800, ; $55 to $65. (Anderson)
(Tuesday and Wednesday) The inscrutable Berlin techno duo jet back to the East Coast between its dual weekends at the Coachella festival ¡ª here it shares the bill with its former collaborator, Thom Yorke of Radiohead ¡ª for two overdue evenings in New York. Their electro beats are chewy and primal. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 486-5400, ; $25. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, ; $25. (Anderson)
(Thursday) After publicly trashing these Canadian rockers for their dishwater-dull riffs, the drummer Patrick Carney of the Black Keys apologized to them last month. Caveat: In Carney¡¯s mind, ¡°There¡¯s much worse bands than Nickelback, maybe,¡± suffices as an apology. With Bush, Seether and My Darkest Days. At 6:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, ; $55 to $125. (Anderson)
(Thursday) All cool young bands worth their A.P.C. trousers are sunning at the Coachella fairgrounds this week, but the experimental artist-producer Daniel Lopatin pledges to keep Brooklyn weird until they return. His textural, ethereal work brims with dark ideas and realized wanderlust; though almost all tracks on ¡°Replica¡± (Mexican Summer/Software) clock under five minutes, they feel meaningful and complete. With Body Language. At 7 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, ; free with museum admission. (Anderson)
(Monday) British shoegaze and Japanese electro-pop find a jocund union in this duo from New York; its singer, Yuki Chikudate, contributes featherweight falsetto and more boisterous keyboards as the guitarist James Hanna supplies dreamy, dense atmospherics. With North Highlands, the comedian Sara Benincasa and the band Little, Big. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, ; $25 in advance, or $30 at the door. (Anderson)
(Friday) Sub Pop Records ¡ª purveyors of the rock zeitgeist since Nirvana hassled them into a contract nearly 25 years ago ¡ª raised eyebrows when they signed this enigmatic hip-hop collective from Seattle. As usual, their vision for the future was 20/20; the group¡¯s debut, ¡°Black Up,¡± is ceaselessly inventive in its terse rhyming flows and bewitching knots of electro, jazz and hip-hop. At 11 p.m., S.O.B.¡¯s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, ; $12. (Anderson)
(Friday and Saturday) Despite hailing from Halifax, England, Mr. Sheeran offers the gently chirping guitar and throaty tenor lilt of modern California surf-pop, i.e. Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz. Only Rainbow Sandals and sand-encrusted shell art seem beyond his extremely long grasp; his glib debut single, ¡°The A Team,¡± went to No. 3 on the British pop charts. With Snow Patrol. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (877) 935-5668, ; sold out. (Anderson)
(Saturday) The ukulele virtuoso from Hawaii suffuses psychedelic decadence into his stereotypically fey instrument of choice; his slick four-string renditions of rock anthems, from the Beatles¡¯ ¡°While My Guitar Gently Weeps¡± to Queen¡¯s ¡°Bohemian Rhapsody,¡± course along on a deft musicianship that evades mere novelty. At 6 and 8:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, ; $35 to $45. (Anderson)
(Thursday and next Friday) A true hip-hop eclectic, Questlove drives the beat for the Roots on ¡°Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,¡± drops flawless transitions as top party D.J. and lends musical cameos to bands whenever he is restless, which appears to be always. He anchors this celebration of current esoteric playlist culture with assistance from Rahzel, Deerhoof, Metropolis Ensemble and more. At 8 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, ; $25 to $45. (Anderson)
