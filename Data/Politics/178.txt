In a sharp departure from past leadership, Malawi¡¯s new president, Joyce Banda, announced Tuesday that an investigation had been opened into the death last year of an activist who had criticized her predecessor, President Bingu wa Mutharika. Ms. Banda, who was vice president under Mr. Mutharika ¡ª who died last Thursday ¡ª also said that she had fired the head of state broadcasting and the minister of information, Patricia Kaliati. Ms. Kaliati was said to have been suspected of being in a group trying to block Ms. Banda¡¯s ascension to office. A day after Ms. Banda took over, she replaced the police chief, Peter Mukhito, who had been closely linked to crackdowns on antigovernment protesters. Speaking of the death of the activist, Robert Chasowa, 25, Ms. Banda said: ¡°I am a mother, and I spent days imagining how my fellow mother felt on the death of her son. People should not just go about murdering people anyhow and get away with it.¡±
