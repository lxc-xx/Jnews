¡¯s party said Thursday that it was negotiating with the government to change the oath of office for lawmakers because it contravened the party¡¯s official platform. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 other members of her party, the National League for Democracy, won seats in Parliament in landmark elections on April 1. The victory was a major step toward reconciliation between the democratic movement and the military-backed government. But the party now says it objects to a part of the oath of office that commands lawmakers to protect and safeguard the country¡¯s Constitution. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly said some articles in the Constitution are undemocratic, including a provision that one quarter of the seats in Parliament are reserved for the military, and the party wants to amend the document.
