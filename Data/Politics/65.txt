The police and education officials on Thursday moved to shut down 14 universities that the government determined did not meet basic academic standards. The schools, with a total of about 38,000 students, were on a list of failing universities, sometimes called ¡°garage universities¡± because of accusations of their low quality. The move is part of a broad effort to improve higher education by President ¡¯s government. The government said it would take a year to close the schools, allowing about 10,000 students who are in their final year of studies to graduate. Most of the remaining students would be given the chance to transfer to other academic programs.
