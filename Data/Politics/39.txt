President of will attend the this weekend in Cartegena, Colombia, the Colombian foreign minister said Tuesday. It would be a show of strength for the socialist stalwart, who has been weakened by cancer and is struggling to convince Venezuelans that he has beaten the disease. He had a relapse of the undisclosed form of abdominal cancer this year after having declared himself cancer-free. It would also give Mr. Ch¨¢vez, 57, who once called President George W. Bush ¡°the devil¡± at the United Nations, a chance to challenge President Obama openly before dozens of regional leaders. ¡°The information that we have is that he will attend,¡± said the foreign minister, Maria ?ngela Holgu¨ªn.
