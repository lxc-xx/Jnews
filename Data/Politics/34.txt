President said Tuesday that he was rescinding a contract awarded to the Brazilian company OAS to build a road through the Amazon, casting further doubt on a project that set off last year. Mr. Morales partly halted work on the most controversial stretch of the road in September, seeking to ease tensions over the $415 million project, which met with strong opposition from his indigenous base. ¡¯s state development bank was to have financed about 80 percent of the project, which has been at the center of Bolivian politics for nearly a year. Mr. Morales had put the road plan at the heart of his drive to increase infrastructure investment in the impoverished nation.
