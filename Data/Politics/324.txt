TUNIS (Reuters) ¡ª ¡¯s Islamist-led government on Wednesday reversed a ban on protests on the capital¡¯s central thoroughfare after an outcry over a violent police crackdown there this week.
It also began an investigation into the crackdown. The police used tear gas and batons to disperse stone-throwing protesters who stormed Habib Bourguiba Avenue on Monday, in defiance of a ban on rallies on a street that was a focal point of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali from the presidency last year.
The protests descended into some of the worst clashes since the revolution, with at least a dozen protesters and eight police officers wounded. Many more walked away with cuts and bruises, while journalists were attacked or had their cameras broken.
The fallout has presented the government, led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, in coalition with two secular groups, with one of the biggest challenges of its four-month rule.
Politicians and activists from the secular opposition have compared the police tactics to those of Mr. Ben Ali¡¯s police state, when freedom was severely curtailed.
Even the president and the Parliament speaker, both coalition allies of Ennahda, called for an investigation. That demand was echoed by the Islamist party itself, which was forced to distance itself from accusations that it had sent in thugs who were seen working with police.
Interior Minister Ali Larayed said the government had agreed to set up a committee to investigate acts of violence and would again allow protests on Habib Bourguiba, subject to conditions on routes and timing.
Cameras will monitor future protests, he said, after protesters and Ennahda officials traded blame over the violence.
Secular opposition parties and human rights activists had used the April 9 anniversary of the 1938 repression of pro-independence protests by French colonial troops to challenge the ban on demonstrations on Habib Bourguiba Avenue.
