Police officers arrested ¡¯s former president on Friday, raiding a house in the capital after he refused a summons to answer questions about corruption charges, law enforcement officials said. Officials initially tried to arrest the former president, Enkhbayar Nambar, on Thursday night. They stopped his car but were foiled by his bodyguards who took him to a nearby compound, setting up a standoff that ended with Friday¡¯s raid, the police said. Now an opposition politician, Mr. Enkhbayar was a formidable figure in Mongolia. Serving as prime minister and then president for most of a decade until losing office in 2009, he presided over a period of robust growth but also a widening wealth gap and, critics said, runaway corruption.
