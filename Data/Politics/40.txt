, ¡¯s most famous rebel artist, said Friday that he had filed a lawsuit with two courts against the Beijing tax authorities for violating his rights in bringing a tax case against him. Tax officials have said Mr. Ai¡¯s company, Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., owes the equivalent of $2.4 million in back taxes and penalties. Mr. Ai says he does not owe that amount and has insisted that his wife, Lu Qing, is formally in charge of the company. Tax officials recently rejected an appeal filed by Mr. Ai. He said Friday that he was filing his lawsuit based on the fact that the tax authorities had not followed proper procedures in bringing their case against him. Mr. Ai said both courts promised to deliver an answer in one week.
