In a marked turnaround, ¡¯s president called Wednesday for the arrest of a notorious ex-warlord who has been serving in the country¡¯s army despite an international indictment on war crimes charges. The ex-warlord, Bosco Ntaganda, is accused of using child soldiers for fighting in northeastern Congo from 2002 to 2003. He was first indicted on war crimes charges in 2006 by the International Criminal Court. President said on Wednesday that Mr. Ntaganda should be arrested and face a military tribunal in Congo, the presidential spokesman Andre Ngwej said. Mr. Kabila said the military did not need to hand Mr. Ntaganda over to the international court. In the past, Mr. Kabila had refused calls to hand over Mr. Ntaganda, arguing his cooperation was essential to keeping the peace in the troubled east of the country where numerous local militias and foreign rebels operate. The Congolese president¡¯s announcement follows clashes this week between troops loyal to Mr. Ntaganda and other soldiers in the Congolese Army in the eastern town of Rutshuru, according to the army spokesman for eastern Congo, Maj. Sylvain Ikenge. ¡°But everything is calm in Rutshuru today, and 90 percent of the troops have remained loyal to the government,¡± he said. Mr. Ntaganda has denied the accusations against him and said he did not fear arrest.
