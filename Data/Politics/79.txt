¡¯s conservative government unveiled new counterterrorism measures on Wednesday to punish those who regularly visit extremist Web sites or travel to weapons-training camps abroad. The move was in response to the killings in southern France last month by a French-born Muslim, , who claimed inspiration from Al Qaeda. The measures now go to Parliament, where they may face resistance from the Socialists, who say that France¡¯s legal arsenal against terrorism is already strong enough and that the proposal is a campaign ploy to bolster President Nicolas Sarkozy¡¯s chances at a second term.
