A new psychiatric evaluation of , who confessed to killing 77 people in last year, concluded Tuesday that he was not psychotic when he carried out the attacks. The report, submitted to a district court in Oslo less than a week before Mr. Breivik¡¯s scheduled trial, contradicted an evaluation last year in which psychiatrists said he had paranoid schizophrenia and was psychotic when he detonated a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people, then drove to the island of Utoya, where he shot and killed 69 people, mostly teenagers at a summer camp run by the governing Labor Party¡¯s youth organization. The new report could give judges grounds to sentence Mr. Breivik, 33, to prison instead of a psychiatric hospital. The court must determine whether Mr. Breivik, who has said he was punishing pro-immigration ¡°traitors,¡± was sane or mentally ill at the time, based on the two reports.
