Gunmen believed to be rebels kidnapped seven Peruvian employees of the Swedish construction company Skanska who were building a natural gas plant in the Amazon jungle, Peruvian officials said Monday. Col. Roland Bayona, a regional police chief, said the gunmen originally seized 30 workers but later freed 23. Members of the Shining Path have not conducted a large kidnapping since 2003, and they have not posed a risk to the stability of the government since the group¡¯s Maoist founders were captured in the early 1990s. The rebels are now deeply involved in the drug trade.
