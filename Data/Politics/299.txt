BEIJING ¡ª Chinese women, like Chinese men, are identified by their surnames followed by their given names. When Chinese women marry, they almost never take their husband¡¯s family name, and instead keep their own, which is typically that of their father¡¯s family.
So why, scholars are wondering, did ¡¯s Communist Party leadership identify Gu Kailai, the wife of the toppled party leader , as ¡°Bogu Kailai¡± when it announced that she was under investigation for the murder of a British business executive?
One explanation is that party leaders wanted to stress the couple¡¯s relationship and intensify the political damage to Mr. Bo.
But some scholars say they see another possible motive. Giving a married woman a new surname that is a combination of her husband¡¯s family name and her own reflects an old custom rarely followed now, but still with resonance among some overseas Chinese.
Calling Ms. Gu Ms. Bogu, in other words, may be a hint that she, despite being married to a member of the Politburo, also holds some other form of identification besides her mainland Chinese one, like a foreign residency permit or a passport. Jiang Weiping, a Chinese journalist who now lives in Canada, said Wednesday night that Ms. Gu once had a residency permit for Singapore.
Under party rules, senior party officials and their spouses are not allowed to hold foreign passports or residence permits. If Ms. Gu, a 53-year-old lawyer, does, the case against her and Mr. Bo could become stronger, scholars said.
Ms. Gu¡¯s official Chinese identification on the registration papers for her law firm is Gu Kailai.
An article Wednesday in the party¡¯s official newspaper, People¡¯s Daily, about new forms of corruption, said ¡°the latest new trend involves foreign ties,¡± including acquiring foreign identities and routing funds abroad.
The timing of the article, a day after the revelations about Mr. Bo and Ms. Gu, suggests it could have been inspired by their case.
