Maoist rebels on Thursday released an Italian tourist guide abducted more than a month ago in eastern after the state government agreed to release five rebels from prison. The guide, Paulo Basusco, was abducted with an Italian tourist, Claudio Colangelo, on March 14 in Orissa State. Mr. Colangelo was released 11 days later, but Mr. Basusco remained in captivity while negotiations took place. The rebels have been fighting in several Indian states for more than four decades, demanding land and jobs for farmers and the poor.
