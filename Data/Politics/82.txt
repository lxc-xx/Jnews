Explosions blasted through the capital, Bissau, and the military sealed off the city¡¯s downtown area and lobbed grenades at the prime minister¡¯s home on Thursday, according to a diplomat and witnesses. The diplomat said the shooting started after the state radio station signal inexplicably went dead. He said that the whereabouts of the interim president, Raimundo Pereira, who took over after the death in January of the previous leader, was unknown. A military official, who like the diplomat could not be named because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said that soldiers had encircled the home of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. and were attacking it with grenades. It was unclear whether Mr. Gomes was inside the house. Mr. Gomes was favored to win an April 29 presidential runoff election. The West African regional bloc known as Ecowas said it condemned ¡°any attempt at a coup d¡¯¨¦tat.¡±
