HONG KONG ¡ª The Chinese government announced on Saturday that it would allow to vary more in value against during each day¡¯s trading, but gave no hint that it would accept the Obama administration¡¯s demands to allow the currency to show a longer-term trend of appreciation against the dollar.
The People¡¯s Bank of China, the country¡¯s central bank, said that effective on Monday it would allow the renminbi to fluctuate up or down in value by as much as 1 percent against a fixed benchmark with the dollar during daily trading. The previous daily limit on volatility, since May 2007, had been 0.5 percent.
But the central bank continues to set the benchmark for each day¡¯s trading of the renminbi. This benchmark has shown virtually no change this year, after slow but steady appreciation last year and in the second half of 2010.
Increasing the allowed range of daily volatility could increase the renminbi¡¯s role in international financial markets. A wider range means that foreign exchange traders will be required to post more capital before placing large bets on the currency. And Chinese exporters may demand that more long-term contracts be written in renminbi instead of dollars to insulate them from exchange rate volatility.
