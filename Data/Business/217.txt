MADRID ¡ª Spanish banks, blocked from the wholesale credit markets, borrowed a record ?316.3 billion from the in March.
That was almost double the ?169.8 billion, or $223.4 billion, that Spanish banks borrowed in February, according to Bank of Spain figures released Friday.
The E.C.B. has supplied euro zone banks with around ?1 trillion of cheap, three-year loans in two tranches in December and February, a lifeline for battered Spanish lenders struggling to find short-term financing.
¡°High funding costs and patchy access to markets will be key challenges for Spanish banks for some time, adding to the pressure on earnings from stricter impairment charges, higher capital requirements and a challenging operating environment,¡± Fitch, the ratings agency, said in a note this week.
Spain is already thought to have slipped back into its second recession in three years as the economy struggles to recover from the bursting of a real estate bubble in 2008 which has also left banks fighting to rebuild their balance sheets.
The government has ordered the banks to strengthen capital levels that were severely damaged by the real estate crisis. Their weakness is another factor on top of rising public debt levels and funding costs that could yet force Madrid to apply for an international bailout.
