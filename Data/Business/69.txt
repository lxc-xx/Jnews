Stocks fell on Friday, giving the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500-stock index its biggest weekly decline of the year, as consumer confidence dropped, China¡¯s growth slowed and the cost of insuring against a Spanish debt default rose to a record.
Financial shares fell the most among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500, following a plunge in European lenders. Technology shares fell 1.6 percent as a group and had the first weekly decline this year.
The S.& P. 500 index fell 17.31 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,370.26, extending its weekly decline to 2 percent. It fell a second week, for the longest losing streak since November. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 136.99 points, or 1.05 percent, to 12,849.59. The Nasdaq composite index fell 44.22 points, or 1.45 percent, to 3,011.33.
¡°Let¡¯s not get overly concerned, but yes, there are concerns out there that we need to look at,¡± said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab. ¡°China has been disappointing, U.S. consumer confidence adds to the pressure and Europe is not out of the woods yet.¡±
Stocks fell as confidence among American consumers cooled in April from a one-year high. China¡¯s growth slowed to the weakest level in almost three years. Credit-default swaps on Spain surged as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy struggled to prevent the nation from becoming the fourth euro-region member to need a bailout.
The decline in stocks followed the biggest two-day rally in 2012. The S.& P. 500, which had its best first quarter since 1998, was still up 9 percent this year as investors bought stocks amid better-than-estimated economic data and expectations that Europe would tame its debt crisis.
Concern about Spain¡¯s borrowing costs drove investors from riskier positions into the perceived safety of fixed-income instruments, sending interest rates down.
The Treasury¡¯s benchmark 10-year note rose 19/32, to 100 3/32, and the yield fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.06 percent late Thursday.
¡°It¡¯s going to be a long process before Europe is out of the woods,¡± said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
¡°It¡¯s a risk-off day. Europe has an effect on our markets as well, and it will have an effect on economic data and how our economy grows.¡±
Concern about the global financial system drove bank stocks lower even after JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Company reported earnings that beat estimates. Bank of America shares sank 5.3 percent, the most in the Dow, to $8.68. JPMorgan stock lost 3.6 percent, to $43.21. Wells Fargo dropped 3.5 percent, to $32.84.
Google shares tumbled 4.1 percent, to $624.60, even as earnings beat estimates. The bid to preserve control for founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin raised concern among corporate-governance watchdogs. Google introduced a plan that lets the company issue new shares without diluting the founders¡¯ voting power.
Shares of Coinstar, the owner of the Redbox movie-rental kiosks, surged 7.3 percent, to $65.78, after the company said first-quarter sales and profit exceeded its previous projection and lifted its earnings forecast for 2012 to at least $4.40 a share.
Stock in Dow Chemical, the chemicals producer, rose 1.6 percent, to $33.20, after it increased its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share, from 25 cents.
The economic slowdown in China raised concern about a decline in demand for crude oil and the June futures contract fell 78 cents, to $103.32 a barrel in New York.
