PARIS ¡ª The warned Thursday that growth in international trade would slow to 3.7 percent in 2012 after decelerating sharply last year, as the global economy lost steam amid turmoil in Europe.
¡°More than three years have passed since the trade collapse of 2008-09, but the world economy and trade remain fragile,¡± Pascal Lamy, the W.T.O. director general, said in a statement. ¡°The further slowing of trade expected in 2012 shows that the downside risks remain high. We are not yet out of the woods.¡±
Mr. Lamy cautioned that with slower growth came the risk that politicians would seek to make a scapegoat of trade, causing damage to the global economy.
¡°The W.T.O. has so far deterred economic nationalism,¡± he said, ¡°but the sluggish pace of recovery raises concerns that a steady trickle of restrictive trade measures could gradually undermine the benefits of trade openness. It is time to do no harm. W.T.O. members should turn their attention to revitalizing the trading system and to ensuring such a scenario does not materialize.¡±
Trade volume grew 5.0 percent in 2011, less than half the 2010 pace of 13.8 percent growth, the organization, which is based in Geneva, . That was below the long-term average of 6.0 percent growth in global trade from 1990 to 2008.
Part of the deceleration last year resulted from the damage to Japanese export industries after the earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Honshu last March. Japanese exports fell 0.5 percent last year, after climbing 27.5 percent in 2010.
Trade was also hurt by the civil war in Libya, which hit oil supplies, and flooding in Thailand that disrupted supply chains.
The developing world, mostly the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, raised its share of global trade, contributing 47 percent of exports and 42 percent of imports, the highest level ever recorded in data that extend back to 1948. Exports from the United States rose a strong 7.2 percent, while imports increased 3.7 percent. Chinese exports climbed 9.3 percent and its imports grew 9.7 percent.
The value of global merchandise trade rose 19 percent in 2011, to a record of $18.2 trillion, topped up by higher commodity prices. That was well above the previous high, set in 2008, of $16.1 trillion.
Economists at the W.T.O. made their 2012 forecast based on the assumption that the global economy would expand 2.1 percent this year, down from 2.4 percent in 2011.
They warned of ¡°severe downside risks for growth that could have even greater negative consequences for trade if they came to pass,¡± and cited the , rising oil prices and geopolitical risks as being of particular concern.
The organization¡¯s economists forecast that growth in global trade volume would recover to 5.6 percent in 2013.
