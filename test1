Life slowly returned to normal in the shaken capital as Kabul residents ventured out on foot and in cars. Those passing by the unfinished buildings commandeered by the insurgents near the Parliament and Embassy Quarter slowed their cars and craned their necks to see the top floors where much of Sunday¡¯s violent drama unfolded, stretching on into the early morning. Inside the buildings, there were unexploded grenades, shattered bits of rocket launchers and bullet casings from the attackers as well as the Afghan crisis response units and their Norwegian special force mentors.

Given the sustained firefights, a remarkably small number of civilians were killed nationwide, just five, officials said. They attributed that in part to the improvement of the Afghan security forces, who they said took strenuous efforts to avoid civilian casualties. It also involved the apparent preference of the attackers, who officials said were from the Haqqani network of the Taliban, for killing soldiers and policemen. Numbers differed on the number of security force members killed ¡ª the Interior Ministry said 8, the president¡¯s office said 11, with 42 wounded.

In one case, in the building the militants attacked across from the Parliament, the attackers let 10 to 15 laborers leave unharmed. But later they killed a man and attempted to kill a number of other civilians taking shelter in a nearby apartment, according to police officers guarding the building on Monday.

Three civilians were killed in the attack in Paktia Province, one in Jalalabad and one in Kabul, with at least two dozen wounded, according to public health officials.

The interior minister, Gen. Bismullah Khan Mohammedi, said the attackers were all from the Haqqani network, coming into the country from their bases in Pakistan.

¡°One of the suicide bombers detained in Jalalabad by the security forces confessed that, yes, they have come from across the border, they have been trained there, and they have been equipped there,¡± General Khan said. ¡°They called themselves a branch of the Haqqani network.¡±

In a statement on Monday, President Hamid Karzai condemned the attacks and appeared to direct some of the blame toward NATO, calling for an investigation into what he said was an ¡°intelligence failure for us and especially NATO.¡± But he praised the performance and the caution exercised by the Afghan security forces, which he said had prevented further civilian deaths and led to a ¡°relatively quick control of the situation.¡±

General Mohammedi said that one reason it had taken many hours to kill the last insurgents, in a building near Parliament, was that government forces had to clear civilians from the building and surrounding area. The building¡¯s top floors were still under construction, but its lower floors were already occupied, primarily by businesses. The Interior Ministry was criticized during last September¡¯s response to the shooting on the American Embassy for recklessly shooting and killing fellow Afghans.

The Afghans managed the response almost entirely on their own, with Western support limited to a small number of embedded training teams and helicopter air support, Western and Afghan officials said.

The most intense attacks in Kabul focused on the Embassy Quarter and the Parliament. But they mostly involved gunfights ¡ª the police said that only one of the militants was wearing an explosive vest, among the group attacking the Embassy Quarter from a nearby building under construction. That attacker was killed in the opening moments of the fight from that location, the police said.

On Monday morning, the unfinished cement floors of the building were littered with ordnance and spent bullet casings. An unexploded rocket-propelled grenade was stuck in a ceiling, while several unexploded grenades, looking like large gray acorns, lay almost camouflaged next to the concrete construction debris, pieces of pipe and metal rods.

Journalists saw 10 dead bodies: attackers, all lying where they had been shot, one on the top floor, two on the stairs between the fourth and fifth floors, one on the fourth -floor landing, another in a half -built room on the second floor and one outside in a checkpoint of the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence service.
